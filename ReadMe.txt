This app was designed to help people stay in touch with their friends by providing an app that keeps track of their last contact with friends via multiple methods. These inputs are then aggregated into a "friendscore" to let users easily know who they should put some effort into contacting. It uses FB Login to retreive the user picture and create a user account.


If experiencing difficulties compiling please delete and reinstall the FB frameworks:

The app settings have been changed so you should have no problem logging in once it compiles.
